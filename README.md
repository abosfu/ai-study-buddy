An AI-powered study buddy that uses OpenAI's GPT model to answer questions across a wide range of subjects. This tool can help students learn and understand various topics by asking questions and getting real-time, AI-generated responses.

## Features

- Ask questions on any topic and get answers.
- Easy setup and usage.
- Utilizes OpenAI’s GPT model to generate answers.
  
## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed.
- A virtual environment tool (like `venv`).
- OpenAI API Key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) if you don't have one).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-study-buddy.git
cd ai-study-buddy

2. Set up a virtual environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv

	•	On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate


	•	On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate



3. Install dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don’t have a requirements.txt file yet, you can generate it with:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. Set up your OpenAI API Key

Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

Replace your-api-key-here with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Run the project

Now you’re ready to use the AI-powered study buddy!

python study_buddy.py

6. Example interaction

Ask me anything: What is an atom?
AI Study Buddy: An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. It consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.
